# `pokemonsay`

This package is fork of [dfrankland/pokemonsay](https://github.com/dfrankland/pokemonsay) (License: MIT).

Pokemon version of cowsay with CLI and API.

![][1]

Inspired by another [`pokemonsay`][2] and [`parrotsay-api`][3] I created this to
quell my obsession with Pokemon and command line greetings. This module includes
all Pokemon and forms available on [Bulbapedia][4] excluding shinies, _a total
of **846**_.

## CLI

### Random

Simply call `pokemonsay` to get a random `Wild POKEMON appeared!` message.

### Piping to `STDIN`

Pipe to `pokemonsay` to get a random Pokemon with the piped message below it.

## API

There are a few methods that are available to utilize `pokemonsay` in your own
app/module!

### `iChooseYou`

- Argument: Object `{ number, pokemon, form }`
- Result: Array of Objects `[{ number, pokemon, form, say }]`

Filter through the database using the available info to get matching Pokemon.
The resulting objects in an array will contain the following properties:

- `number`: National Dex number (integer).
- `pokemon`: The name of the Pokemon.
- `form`: The first letter of the form.
  - Example: "A" for Alola Form (Marowak A-form) or "A" for Attack Form
    (Deoxys A-form)
- `say`: The ANSI compatible string meant for `console.log`ging.

### `random`

- Arguments: Integers `min, max`
- Result: Object `{ number, pokemon, form, say }`

Get a random `pokemonsay` object. An optional `min` and `max` argument can be
used to get Pokemon from a specific generation (including their alternate forms
regardless of generation). The resulting object will contain the following
properties:

- `number`: National Dex number (integer).
- `pokemon`: The name of the Pokemon.
- `form`: The first letter of the form.
  - Example: "A" for Alola Form (Marowak A-form) or "A" for Attack Form
    (Deoxys A-form)
- `say`: The ANSI compatible string meant for `console.log`ging.

### `say`

#### default text (`Wild POKEMON appeared!`)

- Arguments: Object `{ pokemon, form, options }`
- Result: String

Returns a string that shows a box with the message `Wild POKEMON appeared!`
with the specified Pokemon and form. The `options` property is an object that
will override the default settings for [`boxen`][5].

#### custom text

- Arguments: Object `{ text, options }`
- Result: String

Returns a string that shows a box with the message specified. The `options`
property is an object that will override the default settings for [`boxen`][5].
